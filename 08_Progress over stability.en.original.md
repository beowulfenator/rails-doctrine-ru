Progress over stability

When systems have been around for more than a decade, like Rails has, their natural tendency is towards ossification. There are a million reasons why every change might be an issue for someone, somewhere who depended on past behavior. And fair reasons those are too, for the individual.

But if we listen too closely to the voices of conservatism, we’ll never see what’s on the other side. We have to dare occasionally break and change how things are to evolve and grow. It is this evolution that’ll keep Rails fit for survival and prosperity in the decade(s?) to come.

This is all easy to understand in theory, but much harder to swallow in practice. Especially when it’s your application that breaks from a backwards-incompatible change in a major version of Rails. It’s at those times we need to remember this value, that we cherish progress over stability, to give us the strength to debug the busted, figure it out, and move with the times.

That’s not a license to inflict needless or excessive hurt willy nilly. The Great Rails Migration of 2.x to 3 still lingers in the scar tissue of many who were around for that. It was a tough one. A serious upheaval that left many behind in 2.x land for a long time, some soured beyond convincing. But, in the grand scheme of things, it was still worth it.

Those are the hard bargains we have to continue to make. Is Rails going to be better off in five years for the changes we make today? Is Rails going to be better off for adopting another problem domain, like job queuing or WebSockets, in years to come? If yes, then let’s suck it up and do the work.

This work isn’t just something that needs to happen in Rails itself, but also in the larger Ruby community. Rails should be at the frontier of helping Ruby’s progress by driving its constituents to adopt later versions faster.

We’ve done very well at this so far. From when I started, we’ve moved through Ruby 1.6, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, and now onto 2.3. Lots of major changes along the way, but Rails was there to have Ruby’s back, and help everyone get with the program faster. That’s in part the privilege and obligation Rails serves as the major popularizer of Ruby.

This too is true for the auxiliary tools of the chain. Bundler was once a controversial idea, but through Rails' insistence that it be a cornerstone of a shared future, it’s today just taken for granted. The same is true for things like the asset pipeline and Spring, the persistent command process. All three of these went through, or are still going through, growing pains, but the obviousness of their value in the long term helped us push through that.

Progress is ultimately mostly about people and their willingness to push change. This is why there are no lifetime seats in groups like Rails Core or Rails Committers. Both groups are for those who are actively working on making progress for the framework. For some, their stake in such progress may last just a few years, and we will forever be grateful for their service, and for others it may last decades.

Likewise, it’s why it’s so important for us to continue to welcome and encourage new members of the community. We need fresh blood and fresh ideas to make better progress.
